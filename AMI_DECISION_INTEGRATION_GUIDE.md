# üîó Ami Decision Endpoint Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how our improved **Ami 3-Step Workflow** integrates seamlessly with the existing `/decision` endpoint and learning infrastructure to provide human-controlled knowledge saving.

## üîÑ **Complete Integration Flow**

### **Our Improved Ami Workflow:**
```
STEP 1: IMAGINATION ‚Üí CHOICE
STEP 2: CHOICE ‚Üí TEACHING  
STEP 3: TEACHING ‚Üí APPROVAL
```

### **Backend Decision System:**
```
decision endpoint ‚Üí learning tools ‚Üí knowledge saving ‚Üí vector storage
```

## üìã **Step-by-Step Integration**

### **STEP 1: Ami Prompts for Choice**
When humans share their imagination, Ami uses our new transition phrases:

**Ami says:**
- "Which of these AI agent ideas excites you most?"
- "Let's focus on building [specific agent] - does that feel right?"
- "Which agent should we bring to life first?"

**Result:** Human commits to a specific AI agent idea

---

### **STEP 2: Ami Guides to Teaching**
Once they choose, Ami immediately uses our teaching guidance phrases:

**Ami says:**
- "Perfect! Now I need to understand your expertise to build this agent properly."
- "Tell me about your process for [specific task the agent will do]"
- "Walk me through how you currently handle [agent's main responsibility]"

**Result:** Human shares their expertise and know-how

---

### **STEP 3: Ami Requests Approval + Backend Decision Flow**
When human shares knowledge, this triggers our integrated decision workflow:

#### **3A: Ami's Learning Tools Detect Teaching Intent**
```python
# Ami automatically calls:
search_results = search_learning_context(user_message)  
analysis = analyze_learning_opportunity(user_message)
# ‚Üí Analysis detects teaching intent
```

#### **3B: Ami Creates Learning Decision** 
```python
# Ami calls:
decision_result = request_learning_decision(
    decision_type="save_new",
    context="Teaching content detected: [user message]",
    options=["Save as new knowledge", "Skip learning", "Need more context"],
    additional_info="AI analysis detected valuable expertise sharing"
)

# Returns: decision_id = "learning_decision_abc123"
```

#### **3C: Frontend Shows Decision UI**
```javascript
// Frontend polls: GET /api/learning/decisions?user_id=xxx
// Gets pending decisions and shows approval UI to human
```

#### **3D: Human Makes Choice**
```javascript  
// Human clicks "Save as new knowledge"
// Frontend calls: POST /api/learning/decision
{
  "decision_id": "learning_decision_abc123",
  "human_choice": "Save as new knowledge"
}
```

#### **3E: Backend Completes Decision & Saves Knowledge**
```python
# complete_learning_decision() automatically:
# 1. Updates decision status to "COMPLETED"
# 2. Sets human_choice = "Save as new knowledge"  
# 3. Detects approval ‚Üí triggers AVA multi-vector saving
# 4. Saves 3 knowledge vectors to Pinecone
# 5. Returns success confirmation
```

#### **3F: Ami Confirms Knowledge Saved**
```python
# Ami can optionally call save_knowledge() if needed, but
# complete_learning_decision() already handled the saving
```

## üîß **Key Integration Points**

### **1. Decision ID Flow**
```
request_learning_decision() ‚Üí decision_id ‚Üí complete_learning_decision(decision_id) ‚Üí knowledge saved
```

### **2. Automatic Knowledge Saving** 
The `complete_learning_decision()` function **automatically** handles knowledge saving when human approves:
```python
# In complete_learning_decision():
if human_choice == "Save as new knowledge":
    # Automatically calls AVA multi-vector saving
    await ava_instance._save_tool_knowledge_multiple(...)
```

### **3. No Double Saving**
Since `complete_learning_decision()` handles saving automatically, Ami doesn't need to call `save_knowledge()` explicitly in most cases.

### **4. Learning Tools Integration**
Our improved Ami prompt works with all existing learning tools:
- `search_learning_context` - Check existing knowledge
- `analyze_learning_opportunity` - Assess learning value  
- `request_learning_decision` - Create approval request
- `preview_knowledge_save` - Show what would be saved
- `save_knowledge` - Manual save (when needed)

## üéØ **Frontend Integration Requirements**

### **Decision Polling**
```javascript
// Frontend needs to poll for pending decisions
async function pollLearningDecisions(userId) {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/learning/decisions?user_id=${userId}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.decisions;
}
```

### **Decision Submission**
```javascript
// Frontend submits human choice
async function submitDecision(decisionId, humanChoice) {
    const response = await fetch('/api/learning/decision', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            decision_id: decisionId,
            human_choice: humanChoice
        })
    });
    return await response.json();
}
```

### **UI Components Needed**
1. **Decision Alert/Modal** - Shows pending decisions
2. **Approval Options** - "Save", "Skip", "Need more context"  
3. **Knowledge Preview** - Shows what will be saved
4. **Confirmation** - Shows save success/failure

## üöÄ **Example Complete Workflow**

### **M&A Consultant Example**
```
1. User: "Anh l√†m t∆∞ v·∫•n M&A doanh nghi·ªáp"

2. Ami: [Explores imagination, suggests 3 AI agent ideas]
   "Which of these AI agent ideas excites you most?"

3. User: "AI Agent Due Diligence sounds great!"

4. Ami: "Perfect! Now I need to understand your expertise to build this agent properly. 
        Tell me about your due diligence process."

5. User: "Our due diligence process involves 5 key steps: financial analysis, legal review..."

6. Backend: [Ami's learning tools detect teaching intent]
   - search_learning_context() checks existing knowledge  
   - analyze_learning_opportunity() detects high learning value
   - request_learning_decision() creates decision_id="abc123"

7. Frontend: [Polls and shows decision UI]
   "Ami detected valuable expertise about due diligence. Save this knowledge?"
   [Save] [Skip] [Preview]

8. User: [Clicks "Save"]

9. Backend: [complete_learning_decision() called]
   - Updates decision status
   - Triggers AVA multi-vector saving  
   - Saves 3 knowledge vectors about due diligence process

10. Ami: "Excellent! I've saved your due diligence expertise. This will help your AI agent 
         handle due diligence tasks with your specific methodology."
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Implementation Notes**

### **1. Ami's Approval Phrases Trigger Tools**
Our approval request phrases automatically trigger the learning workflow:
- "This is valuable knowledge! Should I save this for your agent?" ‚Üí triggers learning tools
- "I can store this expertise to help your agent perform better." ‚Üí creates decision
- "Would you like me to remember this process for your agent?" ‚Üí requests approval

### **2. Decision Timeout Handling**
```python
# Decisions expire after a certain time
cleanup_expired_decisions()  # Called periodically
```

### **3. Error Handling**
```python
# If decision fails or expires:
save_knowledge(content, decision_id=None)  # Returns error
# Ami should handle gracefully and explain to user
```

### **4. Multi-Vector Saving**
When human approves, the system saves **3 knowledge vectors**:
1. **Combined** (User + AI format)
2. **AI Synthesis** (Enhanced AI understanding)
3. **User Message Only** (For reference)

## üé≠ **Ami's Role in Integration**

### **What Ami Does:**
‚úÖ Guide human through 3-step workflow  
‚úÖ Use transition phrases to push toward teaching  
‚úÖ Trigger learning tools when detecting teaching intent  
‚úÖ Create learning decisions for human approval  
‚úÖ Explain the knowledge saving process to humans

### **What Ami Doesn't Need To Do:**
‚ùå Handle HTTP requests directly  
‚ùå Manage decision storage  
‚ùå Perform actual knowledge saving (handled by backend)  
‚ùå Poll for decision status  

### **What Frontend Does:**
‚úÖ Poll `/api/learning/decisions` for pending decisions  
‚úÖ Show decision UI to humans  
‚úÖ Submit human choices via `/api/learning/decision`  
‚úÖ Display confirmation messages  

### **What Backend Does:**  
‚úÖ Store decisions in `PENDING_LEARNING_DECISIONS`  
‚úÖ Process human choices via `complete_learning_decision()`  
‚úÖ Automatically save knowledge when approved  
‚úÖ Clean up expired decisions
