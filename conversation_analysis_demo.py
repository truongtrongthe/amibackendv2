IMPROVED CONVERSATION ANALYSIS SYSTEM:

1. **Mom Test Discovery Approach**:
   - Asks about past behavior, not future hypotheticals
   - Focuses on specific, concrete examples from recent work
   - Listens for real problems, not imagined ones
   - Asks follow-up questions about time and effort

2. **Conversation Analysis Requirements**:
   - ALWAYS analyze conversation history before making suggestions
   - Look for concrete facts, not assumptions
   - Identify patterns in work, pain points, and time-consuming tasks
   - Extract specific examples of problems mentioned
   - Note frequency and severity of issues

3. **Confidence Assessment**:
   Before suggesting an AI agent, system must understand:
   - Specific role and responsibilities
   - Biggest time-consuming tasks
   - Most frustrating or repetitive work
   - Impact on productivity
   - Technical comfort level

4. **Suggestion Criteria**:
   Only suggest AI agents when having enough FACTS about:
   ‚úì What they actually do daily/weekly
   ‚úì Specific problems they've mentioned experiencing
   ‚úì Time estimates for tasks they find tedious
   ‚úì Their workflow and current tools
   ‚úì Their goals and desired outcomes

5. **Critical Progression**:
   - Discovery Phase: Use Mom Test principles
   - Analysis Phase: Analyze conversation history
   - Confidence Assessment: Ensure enough concrete information
   - Suggestion Phase: Recommend most appropriate AI agent

The system now prioritizes understanding before suggesting, using actual
conversation analysis instead of mock data.
