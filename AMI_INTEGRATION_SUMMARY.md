# 🎯 Ami Decision Integration Summary

## Key Integration Points

### **1. Our Ami Improvement**
We enhanced Ami's system prompt with the **3-Step Workflow**:
```
IMAGINATION → CHOICE → TEACHING → APPROVAL
```

### **2. Existing Decision Infrastructure** 
The system has `/api/learning/decision` endpoint that:
- Stores decisions in `PENDING_LEARNING_DECISIONS`
- Shows approval UI to humans via frontend polling
- Automatically saves knowledge when humans approve

### **3. Seamless Integration**
Our improved Ami prompt **automatically** triggers the decision workflow:

#### **When Ami Says:**
- "Which of these AI agent ideas excites you most?" → Push to CHOICE
- "Tell me about your process..." → Push to TEACHING  
- "This is valuable knowledge! Should I save this for your agent?" → Triggers APPROVAL

#### **Backend Automatically:**
- Detects teaching intent via `analyze_learning_opportunity()`
- Creates decision via `request_learning_decision()` 
- Returns `decision_id` for frontend polling
- Saves knowledge via `complete_learning_decision()` when approved

### **4. No Code Changes Needed**
The integration works with **existing code**:
- ✅ Learning tools already integrated in `exec_tool.py`
- ✅ Decision endpoint already exists in `learning_api_routes.py`  
- ✅ Knowledge saving already handled in `complete_learning_decision()`
- ✅ Frontend just needs to poll `/api/learning/decisions`

## Workflow Example

```
1. User: "I'm a consultant" 
   → Ami: [suggests agents] "Which excites you most?"

2. User: "Due diligence agent!"
   → Ami: "Tell me about your due diligence process..."

3. User: [shares detailed process]
   → Backend: learning_tools detect teaching intent
   → Backend: request_learning_decision() creates decision_id
   → Frontend: polls /api/learning/decisions
   → Frontend: shows "Save this knowledge?" UI

4. Human: clicks "Save"
   → Frontend: POST /api/learning/decision
   → Backend: complete_learning_decision() saves knowledge
   → Backend: 3 knowledge vectors saved to Pinecone
```

## Implementation Status

✅ **Completed**
- Improved Ami system prompts with 3-step workflow
- All 5 prompt variants updated (anthropic, openai, with_tools, with_learning)
- Integration with existing learning tools
- Decision endpoint workflow documented

🔄 **No Changes Needed**
- Backend decision infrastructure works as-is
- Learning tools already integrated
- Knowledge saving already automated

📝 **Frontend Requirements**
- Poll `/api/learning/decisions?user_id={id}` for pending decisions
- Show approval UI when decisions exist
- Submit choices via `POST /api/learning/decision`

**Result: Ami now guides humans through systematic AI agent building via knowledge collection with human approval! 🚀**
