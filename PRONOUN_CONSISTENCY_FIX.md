# Pronoun Consistency Bug Fix

## 🐛 Bug Description

**Issue**: The AI was inconsistently using Vietnamese pronouns ("em" vs "mình") depending on which response strategy was triggered, breaking conversation flow and relationship dynamics.

**Example from logs**:
```
User: "Ơ em nói cái gì thế"
AI: "...mình đã chia sẻ..." (using "mình" - WRONG)

User: "Ok nói rõ hơn về kỹ năng giao tiếp đi"  
AI: "...em có thể..." (using "em" - CORRECT)

User: "Tuyệt"
AI: "...mình luôn sẵn sàng..." (using "mình" again - WRONG)
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The pronoun consistency was **only enforced in the RELEVANT_KNOWLEDGE strategy** but not in other strategies:

| Response Strategy | Pronoun Guidance | Result |
|------------------|------------------|---------|
| **RELEVANT_KNOWLEDGE** | ✅ Had explicit pronoun instructions | Used "em" correctly |
| **CONTEXTUAL_RESPONSE** | ❌ No pronoun guidance | Defaulted to "mình" |
| **LOW_SIMILARITY** | ❌ No pronoun guidance | Defaulted to "mình" |
| **GREETING** | ❌ No pronoun guidance | Defaulted to "mình" |
| **Casual Handling** | ❌ No pronoun guidance | Defaulted to "mình" |

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### 1. **Universal Pronoun Guidance System**

Added two new methods to `tool_learning_support.py`:

```python
def _get_universal_pronoun_guidance(self, conversation_context: str, message_str: str) -> str:
    """Get universal pronoun guidance that applies to ALL response strategies."""
    
def _extract_established_pronouns(self, conversation_context: str, message_str: str) -> str:
    """Extract established pronoun relationships from conversation context and current message."""
```

### 2. **Comprehensive Pronoun Detection**

The system now detects pronoun relationships from:
- **Current message**: "Ơ em nói cái gì thế" → detects "em" relationship
- **Conversation context**: Scans full conversation history for established patterns
- **Multiple patterns**: `['em nói', 'em là', 'em có', 'em sẽ', 'em cần']`

### 3. **Strategy-Agnostic Implementation**

**Before**: Only RELEVANT_KNOWLEDGE strategy had pronoun instructions
```python
# Only in RELEVANT_KNOWLEDGE strategy
"- If the knowledge mentions using 'em/tôi' or specific pronouns, use those exact pronouns yourself"
```

**After**: ALL strategies now include universal pronoun guidance
```python
# In determine_response_strategy() - applies to ALL strategies
pronoun_guidance = self._get_universal_pronoun_guidance(conversation_context, message_str)

# Every strategy now gets:
"instructions": (
    f"{pronoun_guidance}\n\n"
    # ... strategy-specific instructions
)
```

### 4. **Enforcement Rules**

```python
**🔒 CRITICAL PRONOUN CONSISTENCY (APPLIES TO ALL RESPONSES)**:
**MANDATORY CONSISTENCY RULES**:
- ALWAYS maintain the established pronoun relationship throughout the conversation
- If user calls you "em", ALWAYS respond as "em", never switch to "mình" or "tôi"
- If user established themselves as "anh", ALWAYS address them as "anh"
- This applies to ALL response types: casual, formal, knowledge-based, clarifications
- NEVER break pronoun consistency even in brief or casual responses

**VIOLATION PREVENTION**:
- Do NOT use "mình" if "em" relationship is established
- Do NOT switch pronouns mid-conversation
- Do NOT let response strategy override established relationships
```

## 📊 Strategies Updated

All 9 response strategies now include pronoun consistency:

1. ✅ **CLOSING** - Maintains relationship in farewells
2. ✅ **PRACTICE_REQUEST** - Consistent during demonstrations  
3. ✅ **LOW_RELEVANCE_KNOWLEDGE** - Maintains relationship even with poor matches
4. ✅ **FOLLOW_UP** - Preserves context across conversation turns
5. ✅ **GREETING** - Establishes relationship from start
6. ✅ **CONTEXTUAL_RESPONSE** - Uses context to maintain consistency
7. ✅ **LOW_SIMILARITY** - Maintains relationship even without knowledge
8. ✅ **TEACHING_INTENT** - Preserves relationship during learning
9. ✅ **RELEVANT_KNOWLEDGE** - Enhanced existing implementation

## 🧪 Test Results

```bash
=== TEST RESULTS ===
✅ Direct 'em' detection: True
✅ Context 'em' detection: True  
✅ Brief message with context: True
✅ Generates guidance: True

🎉 SUCCESS: Pronoun extraction and guidance generation working correctly!
🎉 The fix should resolve the pronoun consistency bug!
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

**Same conversation with fix**:
```
User: "Ơ em nói cái gì thế"
AI: "...em đã chia sẻ..." (using "em" - CORRECT)

User: "Ok nói rõ hơn về kỹ năng giao tiếp đi"  
AI: "...em có thể..." (using "em" - CONSISTENT)

User: "Tuyệt"
AI: "...em luôn sẵn sàng..." (using "em" - CONSISTENT)
```

## 🔒 Key Features

1. **Universal Application**: Works across all response strategies
2. **Context Awareness**: Extracts relationships from conversation history
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Detects multiple Vietnamese pronoun patterns
4. **Violation Prevention**: Explicit rules against inconsistency
5. **Relationship Memory**: Maintains established dynamics throughout conversation
6. **Fallback Handling**: Covers casual phrases and edge cases

## 🚀 Impact

- **Consistent User Experience**: No more jarring pronoun switches
- **Natural Conversation Flow**: Maintains established relationships
- **Cultural Appropriateness**: Respects Vietnamese language hierarchy
- **Cross-Strategy Reliability**: Works regardless of AI's internal logic path
- **Relationship Preservation**: Maintains user-AI dynamics throughout conversation

This fix ensures that once a pronoun relationship is established (like "anh/em"), it will be consistently maintained across ALL types of responses, regardless of which internal strategy the AI uses to generate the response.
