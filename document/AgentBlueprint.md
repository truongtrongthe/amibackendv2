How This Blueprint Meets Your Needs

True Pitch, Not a Survey:

Unlike the previous form-like structure, this is a narrative written in the agent’s voice, designed to showcase itself to humans as if it’s introducing itself at a meeting.
It feels like a story, not a questionnaire, making it engaging and relatable.


Human-Understandable, No Tech Jargon:

Avoids terms like “API,” “prompt,” or “configuration,” using phrases like “my personal notebook” (for data source) and “passing notes” (for app integrations).
Uses analogies like “helpful pal” or “recipe” to make concepts clear to non-technical users.


Concise:

The pitch is short (1-2 minutes to read), with a clear structure that highlights the agent’s role, capabilities, and benefits without overwhelming the reader.


Self-Aware Agent Role:

The “Meet Me” section is written in the agent’s voice (e.g., “Hi, I’m Shop Buddy!”), ensuring the agent is aware of its primary role.
This maps directly to the agent’s initial prompt, so it consistently communicates its role in interactions.


Visual Workflow:

The “How I Work” section includes a simple text description of the agent’s process and a visual idea (e.g., [Customer] → [Question] → [Answer]) that platforms can turn into a diagram.
This makes the agent’s functionality visually clear without requiring technical skills.


AI-Interpretable with One-to-One Mapping:

Each section maps to an AI component for platforms like Lindy or Voiceflow:

“Meet Me” → Initial prompt and role definition.
“What I Can Do” → Conversation prompts and tone settings.
“Where I Get My Smarts” → Data source configuration.
“Apps I Team Up With” → Tool integrations.
“How I Keep You in the Loop” → Monitoring and fallback settings.
“How I Work” → Workflow logic.


This ensures the pitch can be parsed into executable instructions.


Engaging and Interactive:

The “Try Me Out!” section invites users to test the agent with sample questions, making it interactive and building confidence.
The agent’s friendly, self-aware tone (e.g., “I’m your new favorite helper!”) makes the pitch feel lively and approachable.



How to Use This Blueprint

For Non-Technical Users: Read the example pitch (e.g., Shop Buddy) to understand how your agent can present itself. Use it as a template to write your own agent’s pitch, replacing the example details with your own.
For Agent Builders: Provide this blueprint to users as a model for how agents should introduce themselves. Encourage users to customize it for their needs.
For AI Platforms: Parse the pitch into agent components (prompts, tools, configurations) using the one-to-one mapping. Generate a workflow diagram from the “How I Work” section using tools like Voiceflow’s flow builder.
Testing: Use the “Try Me Out!” questions to test the agent on platforms like Lindy ([https://chat.lindy.ai/signup]) or Voiceflow ([https://creator.voiceflow.com/signup]).
Sharing: If sharing, include a link to the original source ([source link]) and credit the author ([author name]).

Suggestions for Agent Builders

Incorporate into Onboarding: Offer this pitch as a template in onboarding materials, with a video showing how to customize it.
Auto-Generate from Pitch: Build a feature where users paste the pitch into the platform, and it automatically sets up the agent’s prompts, tools, and workflow.
Visual Diagram Tool: Use the “How I Work” visual idea to generate a diagram automatically, using tools like Lindy’s visual editor or Voiceflow’s flow builder.
Community Sharing: Encourage users to share their pitches in communities like Lindy’s Slack ([https://lindy.ai/slack]) or Voiceflow’s 500,000-user network for feedback.

Notes

This blueprint is designed to be a standalone, user-facing pitch that showcases the agent’s capabilities in a fun, relatable way.
It’s concise, avoids technical terms, and includes a visual workflow to make the agent’s process clear.
The agent’s self-aware role is embedded in the “Meet Me” section, ensuring it knows and communicates its purpose.
