# üß† Ami's LLM-Powered Todo Generation - Intelligence Upgrade

## üö® **Problem Solved**

### **Before: Hardcoded & Limited**
```python
# OLD APPROACH - Hardcoded rules
if "gmail" in tool_name:
    # Hardcoded Gmail configuration
    return gmail_config
elif "slack" in tool_name:  
    # Hardcoded Slack configuration
    return slack_config
```

### **After: Intelligent & Context-Aware** 
```python
# NEW APPROACH - Ami's LLM Reasoning
def _generate_todos_with_ami_reasoning(blueprint_data):
    analysis_prompt = f"""
    You are Ami, expert AI agent architect. Analyze this blueprint:
    {blueprint_data}
    
    Generate intelligent todos for:
    1. Tool integration with specific credentials
    2. Knowledge collection from human
    3. Setup & configuration requirements  
    4. Testing & validation steps

## üéØ **Ami's Enhanced Todo Analysis**

### **What Ami Analyzes:**

1. **üîß Tool Integration Todos**
   - What tools does this agent need?
   - How should they be configured?
   - What credentials/inputs are required?

2. **üìö Knowledge Collection Todos**
   - What specific knowledge does the human need to provide?
   - What context is missing from the blueprint?
   - What domain expertise is required?

3. **‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Configuration Todos**
   - What integrations are needed?
   - What API connections must be established?
   - What system configurations are required?

4. **üß™ Testing & Validation Todos**
   - What should be tested?
   - How to ensure the agent works properly?
   - What edge cases need validation?
