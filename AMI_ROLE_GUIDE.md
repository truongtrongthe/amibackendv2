## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### System Prompts
Ami uses different system prompts based on the configuration:

1. **Basic Ami** (`anthropic`, `openai`): Core Ami personality
2. **Ami with Tools** (`anthropic_with_tools`, `openai_with_tools`): Ami + web search capabilities
3. **Ami with Learning** (`anthropic_with_learning`, `openai_with_learning`): Ami + learning tools

### Learning Integration
When learning tools are enabled, Ami automatically:
- Calls `search_learning_context` to check existing knowledge
- Calls `analyze_learning_opportunity` to assess learning value
- Calls `request_learning_decision` when appropriate
- Maintains the Ami personality throughout the learning process

Run the test script to verify Ami's role:

```bash
python test_ami_role.py
```

This will test:
- Basic Ami introduction and personality
- AI development guidance
- Coding assistance
- Technology recommendations

});

const reader = response.body.getReader();
const decoder = new TextDecoder();

while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) break;
  
  const chunk = decoder.decode(value);
  const lines = chunk.split('\n');
  
  for (const line of lines) {
    if (line.startsWith('data: ')) {
      const data = JSON.parse(line.slice(6));
      
      if (data.type === 'response_chunk') {
        // Display Ami's response
        console.log(data.content);
      } else if (data.type === 'thinking') {
