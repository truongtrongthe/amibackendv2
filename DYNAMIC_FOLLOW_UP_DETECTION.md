# Dynamic Follow-Up Detection System

## Overview

This document outlines the transformation from a static, rule-based follow-up detection system to a dynamic, multi-method approach that adapts to conversation patterns and learns from context.

## Current Static Approach Analysis

### Limitations of `_detect_follow_up()`

The original function uses:

1. **Hardcoded Keywords**: Fixed lists for Vietnamese and English confirmations
2. **Static Regex Patterns**: Predefined patterns for follow-up detection
3. **Simple Word Overlap**: Basic intersection of 4+ character words
4. **Fixed Thresholds**: Hardcoded values (5 words for short responses, etc.)

**Problems:**
- Cannot adapt to new languages or domains
- Misses nuanced conversational patterns
- No learning from conversation history
- Fixed confidence scoring
- Limited contextual understanding

## Dynamic Approach: `_detect_follow_up_dynamic()`

### Multi-Method Analysis

The dynamic approach combines four complementary methods:

#### 1. Semantic Similarity Analysis (30% weight)
```python
# Uses embeddings to calculate cosine similarity
message_embedding = await EMBEDDINGS.aembed_query(message)
topic_embedding = await EMBEDDINGS.aembed_query(prior_topic)
semantic_similarity = cosine_similarity(message_embedding, topic_embedding)
```

**Benefits:**
- Language-agnostic semantic understanding
- Captures implicit topic relationships
- Adapts to domain-specific vocabulary

#### 2. LLM-based Contextual Analysis (40% weight)
```python
# Contextual analysis with conversation history
llm_analysis = await self._analyze_follow_up_with_llm(message, prior_topic, conversation_history)
```

**Benefits:**
- Deep contextual understanding
- Handles complex conversational flows
- Adapts to cultural and linguistic nuances
- Provides reasoning for decisions

#### 3. Dynamic Pattern Detection (20% weight)
```python
# Expandable pattern categories
confirmation_patterns = {
    "direct_affirmation": [...],
    "agreement_phrases": [...],
    "continuation_requests": [...]
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Categorized pattern detection
- Easily expandable pattern sets
- Weighted scoring system
- Multi-language support

#### 4. Conversation Flow Analysis (10% weight)
```python
# Analyzes conversation position and coherence
flow_indicators = self._analyze_conversation_flow_indicators(message, conversation_history)
```

**Benefits:**
- Considers message position in conversation
- Analyzes topic continuity
- Evaluates conversational coherence

### Weighted Scoring System

```python
weights = {
    "semantic": 0.3,    # Embedding similarity
    "llm": 0.4,         # LLM contextual analysis
    "linguistic": 0.2,  # Pattern detection
    "flow": 0.1         # Conversation flow
}

combined_confidence = sum(weights[method] * scores[method] for method in weights)
```

## Hybrid Approach: `_detect_follow_up_hybrid()`

### Best of Both Worlds

The hybrid approach provides:

1. **Primary**: Dynamic detection for high-confidence cases (>0.7)
2. **Validation**: Static detection for medium-confidence cases
3. **Fallback**: Static detection when dynamic fails

```python
if dynamic_result.get("confidence", 0.0) > 0.7:
    return dynamic_result  # High confidence dynamic
else:
    # Combine dynamic + static for validation
    return combined_result
```

## Implementation Benefits

### 1. Adaptability
- **Language Evolution**: Learns new patterns from conversation
- **Domain Adaptation**: Adjusts to specific business contexts
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Understands cultural communication patterns

### 2. Accuracy Improvements
- **Multi-Method Validation**: Reduces false positives/negatives
- **Contextual Understanding**: Better handles ambiguous cases
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides reliability metrics

### 3. Maintainability
- **Modular Design**: Each method can be improved independently
- **Expandable Patterns**: Easy to add new pattern categories
- **Configurable Weights**: Adjust method importance based on performance

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **Caching**: Embeddings can be cached for repeated queries
- **Selective LLM Use**: Only for ambiguous cases (0.3-0.7 similarity)
- **Fallback Strategy**: Ensures system reliability

## Usage Examples

### Basic Dynamic Detection
```python
result = await processor._detect_follow_up_dynamic(
    message="Yes, tell me more about that",
    prior_topic="Customer segmentation strategies",
    conversation_history=["What are the main types?", "There are three main types..."]
)

# Result:
{
    "is_follow_up": True,
    "is_confirmation": True,
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "High semantic similarity (0.72); LLM: Clear confirmation request; Patterns: confirmation_direct_affirmation",
    "semantic_similarity": 0.72,
    "method_scores": {
        "semantic": 0.72,
        "llm": 0.90,
        "linguistic": 0.80,
        "flow": 0.60
    }
}
```

### Hybrid Detection
```python
result = await processor._detect_follow_up_hybrid(
    message="Về cái đó",  # Vietnamese: "About that"
    prior_topic="Phân nhóm khách hàng",  # "Customer segmentation"
    conversation_history=[...]
)

# Automatically chooses best method based on confidence
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Implementation
- Keep existing `_detect_follow_up()` as fallback
- Implement `_detect_follow_up_dynamic()` alongside
- Use hybrid approach for gradual transition

### Phase 2: Performance Monitoring
- Compare accuracy between static and dynamic methods
- Monitor confidence scores and reasoning quality
- Adjust weights based on performance metrics

### Phase 3: Full Migration
- Replace static calls with hybrid approach
- Optimize weights based on real-world performance
- Remove static method when confidence is high

## Configuration Options

### Adjustable Parameters
```python
# Method weights (must sum to 1.0)
DETECTION_WEIGHTS = {
    "semantic": 0.3,
    "llm": 0.4,
    "linguistic": 0.2,
    "flow": 0.1
}

# Confidence thresholds
HIGH_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.7
MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.5

# LLM usage optimization
USE_LLM_FOR_AMBIGUOUS = True
AMBIGUOUS_RANGE = (0.3, 0.7)

# Caching settings
CACHE_EMBEDDINGS = True
CACHE_TTL_SECONDS = 3600
```

### Pattern Expansion
```python
# Easy to add new pattern categories
NEW_PATTERNS = {
    "technical_confirmations": [
        r'\b(implement|deploy|execute|run)\b',
        r'\b(triển khai|thực hiện|chạy)\b'
    ],
    "emotional_agreements": [
        r'\b(love it|sounds great|perfect)\b',
        r'\b(tuyệt vời|hoàn hảo|rất tốt)\b'
    ]
}
```

## Future Enhancements
